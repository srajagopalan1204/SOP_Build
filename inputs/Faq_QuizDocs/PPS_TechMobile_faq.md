## Process FAQ

**SOP:** M1. Tech Mobile  

---

### 1. What is the purpose of the Tech Mobile SOP?

The **Tech Mobile** SOP (M1 – Tech Mobile) describes the end-to-end flow for a field technician
using Tech Mobile on a trouble-service call. It covers:

- **S1. Appointment is Scheduled for Trouble Service**  
- **S2. Travel to the Appointment / Site**  
- **S3. Perform On-Site Work**  
- **S4. Add Additional Material**  
- **S5. Create New SRO** (for extra work beyond the original scope)  
- **S6. Travel Leaving Site**  
- **S7. Change Status to indicate Call Back service**  
- **S8. Change Status to Closed**, and  
- The end / sub-SOP markers **S998 / S999**.

The goal is to make sure every technician follows a consistent, visible process from the moment
the appointment is scheduled through to closure or callback.

---

### 2. Where does this SOP start and end?

- The SOP starts when an **appointment is scheduled for trouble service (S1)** and the call is
  visible to the technician in Tech Mobile.  
- It ends after the technician has:
  - Travelled to the site (S2).  
  - Performed the on-site work (S3).  
  - Addressed additional material and additional work decisions (Q1, Q2, Q3 with S4 and S5).  
  - Travelled away from the site (S6).  
  - Either:
    - **Closed** the SRO (S8), or  
    - Flagged it as **callback** (S7), and/or  
    - Reached an **end/sub-SOP** node (S998 / S999).  

At that point, the work can move on to billing, follow-up, or another SOP as appropriate.

### 3. How does appointment scheduling (S1) connect to Tech Mobile?

**S1. Appointment is Scheduled for Trouble Service** represents the trigger for the Tech Mobile
process:

- The call is created and scheduled in the back-office system.  
- The technician sees the job in Tech Mobile as an assigned appointment.  
- Once the technician is ready to head to the job, they move into **S2. Travel to the Appointment / Site**.

This makes sure the field technician, dispatcher, and back office are all looking at the same job.

---

### 4. What does “Travel to the Appointment / Site” (S2) represent?

**S2. Travel to the Appointment / Site** is used when the technician is leaving their starting
location (shop, home, prior job) and heading toward the customer site:

- The technician updates their status to show they are **travelling to the site**.  
- Dispatch and the office can see that the tech is en route.  
- Travel time can be captured according to local rules.

Once the technician arrives, they move to **S3. Perform On-Site Work**.

---

### 5. How are additional materials handled (Q1 and S4)?

If the technician discovers that **additional material is needed** beyond what is listed on the
original SRO:

- They answer **Q1. Additional Material Needed?**  
- When the answer is **Yes**, they follow **S4. Add Additional Material** to add the extra parts
  or materials to the job.  

This ensures that:

- Material usage is accurate.  
- Inventory is correct.  
- The customer is billed appropriately for the additional material.

---

### 6. When is a new SRO created for extra work (Q2 and S5)?

Sometimes the technician identifies **additional work** that is beyond the scope of the original
SRO (for example, additional issues discovered during troubleshooting):

- They answer **Q2. Additional Work Required Other Than That Shown in Original SRO?**  
- When the answer is **Yes**, they use **S5. Create New SRO** to create a separate SRO for that
  additional work.  

This keeps:

- The original SRO focused on the work that was originally requested.  
- The extra work properly documented and billed under its own SRO, making reporting and billing
  clearer.

---

### 7. How does “Can the Additional Work Be Completed At That Time?” (Q3) affect the flow?

If additional work is required, the technician must decide whether it can be completed on the
current visit:

- **Q3. Can The Additional Work Be Completed At That Time?**  
  - If **Yes**, the technician completes the additional work in the same visit and then proceeds
    to **S6. Travel Leaving Site** and ultimately **S8. Change Status to Closed**.  
  - If **No**, the technician uses **S7. Change Status to indicate Call Back service** so that a
    follow-up visit can be scheduled.

This helps distinguish between **same-visit completion** and **true callback work**.

---

### 8. What is the purpose of “Travel Leaving Site” (S6)?

**S6. Travel Leaving Site** is used when the technician is **leaving the customer site**:

- Status is updated in Tech Mobile to indicate travel away from the site.  
- Travel time back to shop or to the next job can be tracked.  
- The office can see that on-site work is complete and the technician is in transit.

After S6, the technician or office moves the SRO towards closure (S8) or ensures callback status
(S7) is correctly set.

---

### 9. When should I use “Call Back” (S7) versus “Closed” (S8)?

- Use **S7. Change Status to indicate Call Back service** when:
  - Additional work is still required.  
  - A return visit must be scheduled.  
  - The job is not finished from the customer’s perspective.  

- Use **S8. Change Status to Closed** when:
  - All planned and agreed work on that SRO is complete.  
  - Any additional material/work has been documented.  
  - The job is ready to move on to billing and closure.

Choosing correctly between S7 and S8 improves schedule accuracy and customer communication.

---

### 10. What do S998 and S999 represent in the Tech Mobile SOP?

The Tech Mobile SOP uses **S998** and **S999** to mark the **end** of this process and to indicate
links to other SOPs:

- **S998** is often used as a “restart / selection” or routing step.  
- **S999. via S998. END** represents reaching the end of this SOP or branching into a **sub or
  separate SOP** (for example, another process that continues after Tech Mobile).  

These markers help show where Tech Mobile hands off to another defined SOP while preserving
traceability of the overall service process.
