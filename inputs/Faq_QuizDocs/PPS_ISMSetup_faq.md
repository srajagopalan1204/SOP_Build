# PPS – ISM Setup – At PPS Service  
## Process FAQ

**SOP:** M1. ISM Setup – At PPS Service  

---

### 1. What is the purpose of the ISM Setup SOP at PPS Service?

The ISM Setup SOP provides a **single hub** for setting up key ISM master data used by PPS Service. It covers:

- Partner setup (service partners / vendors).  
- Partner schedule setup.  
- Work codes.  
- Warranty-specific GL accounts.  
- Service order templates (SRO templates).  
- Warranty codes.  
- Rates.  
- Contract templates for rental and service contracts.  

By using this SOP, PPS Service ensures that all of these elements are set up consistently before they are used in day-to-day service work.

### 2. Where does this SOP start and end?

- The process starts when a user realizes, “I need to set up or change something in ISM for PPS Service” – for example, a new partner, a new work code, or a new contract template – and navigates into the ISM Setup SOP.  
- It ends after the appropriate setup step (S1–S9) is completed and the user either uses **S998. Restart Selection** to perform another setup task or exits back to their transactional SOPs (such as Start-Up, Rental, PMA, etc.).  

In other words, this SOP is a **configuration / master data** companion to the transactional service SOPs.

### 3. How does the SOP help with Partner setup (S1) and Partner schedules (S2)?

The ISM Setup SOP includes distinct steps for partners and their schedules:

- **S1. Partner Set Up** – used when PPS needs to add or maintain a **partner** (for example, an external service provider or subcontractor).  
- **S2. Partner Schedule Set Up** – used to define or maintain the **schedule / availability** for a partner (for example, working days, hours, and other scheduling rules).  

The decisions (D1, D2, etc.) in the flow help the user choose the correct path based on what they are trying to set up.

### 4. What is the difference between a Work Code (S3) and a Partner Schedule (S2)?

- A **partner schedule** (S2) defines “**when**” and “**how**” a partner is available for work (for example, Monday–Friday 8:00–4:30).  
- A **work code** (S3. Create A Work Code) defines “**what type of work**” is being performed (for example, Start-Up, Inspection, Warranty Service, Rental Return Check).  

Partner schedules support the **calendar view** of work, while work codes support how work is categorized, quoted, and billed.

### 5. How are warranty-specific GL accounts handled (S4)?

**S4. Warranty Specific GL** is used to define or adjust the **General Ledger accounts** that should be used for warranty work. This helps PPS:

- Keep warranty revenue and cost separate from standard billable work.  
- Report accurately on warranty exposure and cost.  
- Ensure consistency in how warranty transactions post in the financials.  

Having warranty GL correctly set up in advance avoids manual corrections later.

---

### 6. Why do we need SRO templates (S5)?

**S5. Create an SRO Template** is used to create **reusable service order templates**. These templates can:

- Pre-load common lines and defaults for specific job types (for example, generator start-up, rental inspection).  
- Reduce keying time and errors for coordinators and dispatchers.  
- Ensure that key fields and codes (work codes, warranty codes, rates) are applied consistently.  

Templates are especially helpful for high-volume or standardized service offerings.

---

### 7. What are Warranty Codes (S6) used for?

**S6. Create A Warranty Code** is used to define or maintain **warranty codes** that:

- Indicate the warranty status of work being performed.  
- Drive specific rules or behaviors for billing and GL posting.  
- Help with reporting on warranty activity and cost.  

Having clear warranty codes makes it easier to distinguish warranty work from normal billable service.

---

### 8. Why are Rates (S7) important in ISM Setup?

**S7. Set Up a Rate** defines the **rates** that will be applied in service work:

- Labor rates by technician, skill, or customer type.  
- Special project or contract-specific rates.  
- Other rate structures required by the business.  

These rates can then be referenced by work codes, SRO templates, and contracts, ensuring that billing calculations are correct and consistent.

---

### 9. How do Contract Templates (S8 and S9) fit into the process?

The SOP includes two contract template paths:

- **S8. Create a Contract Rental Template** – used when PPS needs a template for **rental contracts** (for example, rental of generators or equipment).  
- **S9. Create a Service Contract Template** – used when PPS needs a template for **service contracts** (for example, PMA-style agreements or multi-year service commitments).  

Both templates help standardize terms, billing patterns, and included services for contract-based work.

---

### 10. What is S998 – Restart Selection, and when is it used?

**S998. Restart Selection** is a convenience step that lets the user:

- Return to the **decision hub** without exiting the SOP.  
- Choose another setup task (for example, after setting up a partner, the user might next set up a work code or a rate).  

This reinforces that the ISM Setup SOP is a **menu-style hub** for configuration work: you can perform multiple related setup tasks in one session, using S998 to loop back as needed.
