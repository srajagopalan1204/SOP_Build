In the mid 1900 's it used also go by the name Planned Maintenance Schedule. However that was retired as it did not convey the fact that it is a contractual agreement.

from that point the process traverses the creation of a customized contract for the owner , followed by setting  up schedule that satisfies the customer and our terms of the agreement , followed by creation of the SRO , finally when the time is right scheduling a technician , then the technician services the unit as per the tasks laid out in the SRO, finally an invoice is generated and as per the terms payment is collected.
