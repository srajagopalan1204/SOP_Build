In the mid 1900 's it used also go by the name Planned Maintenance Schedule. However that was retired as it did not convey the fact that it is a contractual agreement.  The process begins with either a sales person contacting the owner of newly installed generator or the service tech highlights the advantage of having a PMA to the new generator owner or the owner on their own accord calling PPS to discuss the options for a PMA.
from that point the process traverses the creation of a customized contract for the owner , followed by setting  up schedule that satisfies the customer and our terms of the agreement , followed by creation of the SRO , finally when the time is right scheduling a technician , then the technician services the unit as per the tasks laid out in the SRO, finally an invoice is generated and as per the terms payment is collected.

To be confident in your day-to-day work—and to avoid surprises at Go Live or when you move into a new role—please set aside time to practice this SOP in the training environment. Working through realistic examples several times will help you:• Follow the steps in the correct sequence• Understand what the key fields and options do• Reduce errors when you work in the live system• Handle real customer and business situations with confidence

The training environment is the safest place to practice, ask questions, and learn from mistakes—before they affect real orders, inventory, equipment, or customers. The more you use the training environment now, the smoother your work will be later in the live system.
