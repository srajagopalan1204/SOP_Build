Create Add Kit Components â€” In Sales Order Entry, you can source single or multiple components for build-on-demand (BOD) or nonstock kits. You can tie a stock or nonstock component line to a purchase order or warehouse transfer, including a direct order. If a component of the prebuilt kit is another prebuilt kit, then you can tie the component kit to a work order. Kit component sourcing is initiated on the Kits page in Advanced Line Entry. You can source one or more components from the Multi-Comp Sourcing page. You can also source a component when you add a component to a kit. If you create a fabricated kit in Sales Order Entry, then you must source the components in KP Work Order Center Entry. Ties are only created if the quantity ordered is less than the quantity reserved. To create a tie for a component that has the full quantity reserved, add the kit to the sales order without sourcing the component. Then, in the Kit Details section for the component, change the reserved amount for component to less than the quantity needed before creating the tie. The tie is created for the quantity ordered less the quantity reserved. Note: You cannot delete a component that is tied to a source document from a sales order. Use these instructions to create a tie for one or more components: Create a stock order. In Advanced Line Entry, specify the BOD or nonstock kit in the Product field, and then specify the quantity. Click Kits. Select one or more components to tie to a sourcing document, and then click Multi-Comp Sourcing. Specify the product source. Complete the remaining fields for the selected product source. When you are sourcing a single component, the ARP vendor or warehouse is displayed. When you are sourcing multiple components, the ARP vendor or warehouse is not displayed because the ARP for each component can be different. Click Submit, and then click the left arrow to return to Advanced Line Entry. Click Add to add the line to the order. .

Confirm Pricing â€” Selling products for highest price paid If a customer places an order for a product and has historically paid a higher price than the price that defaults in Sales Order Entry, you can set system options to force the higher price for that product and customer. This ensures that the customer is not offered the product at a price less than they are accustomed to paying, and you receive the highest margin on the sale. This may also encourage customers to agree to a contract price to receive a better price in the future. To implement the Highest Price Paid pricing search, you must set two options in SA Administrator Options-Documents-Sales Orders: Months History and Exclude Level 2. These options define the number of months of sales history to search for the highest price, and whether to exclude Price Type Level 2 sales in the search. The Highest Price Paid search is not conducted if the original default price was determined using a contract price. A contract price is a Price Type level 1 (Customer/Product) PD Pricing Setup record. The contract price is not changed by the Highest Price Paid search. Additionally, if you use Price Type level 2 pricing records (Cust/Prod Price Type, Cust/Prod Line, Cust/Prod Cat, or Cust/Rebate Type), and the Exclude Level 2 option is selected, any prices that originally default on the sales order line using level 2 pricing records are not overridden by the highest price paid. If you use promotional pricing, you still have the option to choose between the promotional price and non-promotional price. The non-promotional price reflects the highest price, if it applies. If you do not have permission to select a promotional price (the Access Promo Price in OE option in SA Operator Setup-Entry Options is not selected), the Promo Price Default selection in SA Administrator Options-Documents-Sales Orders determines the price to use: Lowest, Promo, or Regular. This automatic selection may result in the promo price instead of the highest price being selected. You can override contractual level pricing with multiple level price search. This pricing search can conflict with the Highest Price Paid search. We recommend you select one method or the other, not both. When a sales order line price is replaced with a higher price by this search, the order number, suffix, and line number are stored on the new order line. In addition, the Price Origin Code is set to â€œHâ€. This code is displayed in Sales Order Inquiry and Sales Customer Pricing Inquiry. To prevent the highest price search in Sales Customer Pricing Inquiry, select Return/Ignore Highest Price. Run the Sales Order Master List Report to see the Highest Price Order and Line that affected the Highest Price calculation.
