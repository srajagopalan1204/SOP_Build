If the check box is selected at the transaction level, only the transaction is ignored and all other transactions not on hold are invoiced.
A default value for new SROs can be set on the Service Order tab of the Service Parameters form.

Consider Planned for Partial Billing
Select this check box if you want to prevent service orders from invoicing when unposted planned transactions exist, where the reference type and number are not blank.

Configuration Change History Branch
If your system uses the Auto Append method for unit configuration updates, the value you specify here is used to determine the name of the branch in the configuration that holds components that are added or removed when SRO material transactions are posted. We recommend that you change this value every year, to track components in a separate node each year.
Specify this information on the Other tab:
Use Separate Consumer
Select this check box to maintain consumer records in the consumer database instead of the customer database. If you select this check box, incidents will always be billed to customers and you will not have the option to bill an incident to a consumer.

Calculated/Time and Material: Price is calculated as the sum of all material, labor, and miscellaneous items issued.
Project/Fixed: Price is based on the manually entered fixed amount.
Billing Code
Select the default billing code to use on service orders. This code determines the amount to billed for SRO material and labor transactions.
Note: When integrated to SX.e and the billing code for service orders is set to Recover, instead of the journal cost, the replacement cost from SX.e is used as the price for service order transactions.
To use this feature, select the Use Replacement Cost For Recover Billing Code option on the SX.e BODs tab on the Integration Parameters form.

For more information, see Billing Code.

Warehouse
Select the default warehouse to use for service orders. Warehouses are set up and maintained through the Warehouses form.
Default SRO Template
Select the SRO template to use by default when creating new service request orders.
Material Transaction Type
Select a value to use as the default when you add planned or actual material transactions through the Service Order Transactions form.
Purchasing Misc Code
Select a value to use as the default miscellaneous code. Miscellaneous codes are unique, alphanumeric codes that represent a type of expense charged to an SRO. Use these codes to ensure that the expenses are charged to the proper general ledger account.
Purchasing Pay Type
Select a default payment type to use for service orders. Only payment types that do not reimburse the partner can be assigned. This field is referenced when users create manual checks for service orders on the A/P Check Writer Workbench.
Demand Consumption Method
Select a method to use to consume demand:
Service Order: Consume demand across the whole SRO based on the item only.
Service Order Line: Consume demand across each SRO line based on the item only. Use this option in situations where planning occurs on one operation but materials are issued on another operation.
Service Order Operation: Consume demand by matching planned transactions created for an item on a SRO operation, regardless of the planned warehouse. Use this option when you do not know which warehouse or partner will be assigned to the service order.
Warehouse: This is the default setting. Consume demand by matching on the SRO, line, operation, item, and warehouse.
Status Code
Select the working status code to use by default for service orders.
Note: The selected code must have the Available For Service Orders check box selected.
Partial Billing
Select this check box if you want the SRO Invoice Print/Post program to bill an SRO or SRO transaction with a status of bill hold. If the check box is selected at the header level, the system ignores the entire SRO. If the check box is selected at the transaction level, only the transaction is ignored and all other transactions not on hold are invoiced.
A default value for new SROs can be set on the Service Order tab of the Service Parameters form.

Consider Planned for Partial Billing
Select this check box if you want to prevent service orders from invoicing when unposted planned transactions exist, where the reference type and number are not blank.
When selected, the system checks if any unposted planned transaction exists that has a linked cross-reference. If such a transaction is found, invoicing is not allowed.

Use this parameter when you have not enabled Partial Billing.

Suppress Warranty Claim Invoice Printout
Select this parameter to stop warranty claim invoices from printing when invoicing is completed.
Accumulate WIP
Specify a default value to use for this field on new service orders. If this field is selected, costs issued to the SRO are stored in WIP accounts. Otherwise, costs are posted directly to cost of goods (COGS) accounts.
Planned Transaction Required
Specify a default value to use for this field on new service orders. If this field is selected, then a planned transaction must exist before the line or operation can be invoiced.
Use Planned Pricing
Specify a default value to use for this field on new service orders. If this field is selected, the SRO uses planned pricing. Otherwise pricing is based on partner, codes, and customer.
Use End User Types
Select this check box if you want to use end user types for service orders or sales orders. If selected, a new field is displayed on the Customer tab of the Service Orders form or on the Details tab of the Sales Orders form to hold the end user type. The default value for this field is from the end user type specified on the Codes tab of the Customers form. This value can be changed for each individual service order. As material, labor, and miscellaneous transactions are posted against the service order, the system uses the end user type, if it is not blank, to acquire the sales and cost of goods sold account numbers.
This option can be defaulted for new service orders on the Service Order tab of the Service Parameters form.

Work Entry Auto Post Labor
Select this check box if transactions entered through the SRO Labor Clock Off form are added to the service order as posted actual transactions. Otherwise, they are added as unposted actual transactions.
Work Entry Auto Post Material
Select this check box if transactions entered through the SRO Labor Entry form are added to the service order as posted actual transactions. Otherwise, they are added as unposted actual transactions.
Work Entry Auto Post Miscellaneous
Select this check box to automatically post a transaction when a miscellaneous transaction is saved on the SRO Miscellaneous Entry form.
Include SRO Allocations
Select this check box to include the outstanding demand quantity for service orders in the Alloc Order field of the Item/Warehouse form
Auto Dispatch SRO on Quick SRO Create
Use this check box to set the default value for the Auto Dispatch SRO on Copy/Create field on the Service Order Quick Create form. That field determines whether a schedule record is automatically added to a service order created using the SRO Copy/Create Utility, when the SRO Lead Partner is assigned. The dispatch record is displayed in the grid section of the Schedules tab on the Service Orders form when this feature is enabled.
Allow SPA Pricing
Select this check box if special pricing agreements (SPAs) should be in effect for service orders.
Auto Close SRO After Invoicing
Select this check box to set the SRO status to Closed when invoicing is complete (regardless of the Close Date value). If you do not select this check box, manually populating the Close Date field of the SRO causes it to close after invoicing. The default value of the Service Order field comes from the template if created through the SRO Template, and if not, from the Service Parameters.
Lock Estimate on Approval
Use this check box to set the default value for the Estimate Lock field on the Service Orders form. When this field is selected, users cannot change (add/update/delete) Estimate SRO Transactions for the service order.
Check for Service Bulletin on SRO Line Entry
Select this check box if you want the system to check if a relevant service bulletin exists when a service order line is created.
Default Consumed On Planned Transactions
The field is selected by default. When selected, new planned transactions, by default, are marked as consumed in the Consumed column on the grid section of planned transactions, on the Service Order Transactions form. To mark by default new planned transactions as not consumed, clear the Default Consumed on Planned Transactions check box.
You can use the Consumed column on the grid section of planned transactions, on the Service Order Transactions form, to manually indicate whether a planned transaction is consumed or not, without drilling into the transaction. This feature is also available in the ISM mobile application.

Loaner Warehouse and Loaner Location
Select the default warehouse and location to use for the material and line material transaction types Loaner Shipment and Loaner Return.

Partner Reimbursement Accounts
Specify the Voucher, Credit, and Other accounts where expenses for SRO material, labor and miscellaneous transactions are posted for any transaction that is reimbursed to the partner. The amount is held in these accounts until moved out by reimbursing the partner. The account that is used depends on the method by which the partner is set up to be reimbursed. These accounts are considered control accounts and are locked down accordingly.
Number of Hours Per Day
Specify the maximum number of hours per day a partner can be scheduled.
Schedule Board Read Only
Select this check box if you want to make the schedule board on the Schedules form read-only.
Specify this information on the Amortization Control tab:

Specify this information on the Unit tab:
Auto Build Unit Configuration on Shipment
If you select this field, the complete unit configuration is created as the item is shipped. Both the installation and ship date are set to the date when the shipment occurred. The Auto Build process runs through the default configuration of serial-tracked items to be built. This may add time to the shipping process if the bill of materials is several levels deep.
Auto Build Unit Configuration on Receipt
If you select this field, the complete unit configuration is created as the item is received. During the posting of a PO receipt of a serial-tracked item, a new unit is automatically created (inventory status set to ""In Inventory"") and the purchase order information is associated with the unit. If the Auto Build Configuration on Receipt field is selected, the configuration is created. If a warranty that is based on the Receive Date is associated with the unit or any of its components, the start date of each warranty is set to the day the unit was received. The Auto Build process runs through the default configuration of serial-tracked items to be built. This may add time to the receiving process if the item configuration is several levels deep.
Set Install Date on Shipment
If you select this check box, the system sets the Install Date on the unit and its components to the date the unit is shipped. If the unit is shipped and then installed by a field technician at a later time, do not select this check box.
Initial Configuration Display
Specify the number of levels the unit configuration expands by default.
Configuration Update Method
Specify how the system updates the unit configuration when an SRO Material Transaction is updated:
Auto Synch: The system tries to add and remove configuration components without user intervention.
Auto Append: The system tracks any additions or removals in a separate branch of the configuration tree.
Prompt: Prompt users to determine whether they want to manually adjust the configuration.
Never: The unit configuration is not affected by posted material transactions.
Note: For more information about this field and the following two fields, see Unit Configuration Automation Control.
Default Configuration Removal Reason
Specify a default reason that the system uses when a component is removed through the Auto Sync or Auto Append method. This value is also used as the default reason on the Unit Configurations form when the Remove Date is manually specified for a component.
Configuration Change History Branch
If your system uses the Auto Append method for unit configuration updates, the value you specify here is used to determine the name of the branch in the configuration that holds components that are added or removed when SRO material transactions are posted. We recommend that you change this value every year, to track components in a separate node each year.
Specify this information on the Other tab:
Use Separate Consumer
Select this check box to maintain consumer records in the consumer database instead of the customer database. If you select this check box, incidents will always be billed to customers and you will not have the option to bill an incident to a consumer. This check box is useful if your business is directed at consumers who are not invoiced for parts and services and you would prefer to market to consumers separately from customers.
Default Customer
Select the customer number to use by default on the Consumers form each time a new consumer record is created.
Commission Due on Payment
Select this check box to require a commission to be due when the invoice is fully paid. Or, when a customer makes a partial payment on the invoice, the a commission due payment is generated and prorated (although the invoice is not paid in full). Clear this check box to require a commission to be due when the order is invoiced.
Enable Schedule Events
Select this check box to enable event triggers for appointments, service orders, and service order operations.
A system administrator determines the actions that are triggered and sets them up on the Event Handlers form.
